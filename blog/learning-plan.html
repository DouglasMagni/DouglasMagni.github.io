    <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
    <p>
      The ultimate goal is to have a solid career as a software developer so
      that I have location flexibility.
    </p>

    <h2>
      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
    </h2>
    <p>
      I have some difficulty to learn through reading, sometimes when it's a
      difficult content, I need to read again to completely absorb the idea. I
      would always prefer to whatch videos instead of reading tutorials.
    </p>

    <h2>
      What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
      developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h2>
    <p>
      I would love to see my ability to work well under pressure to improve. At
      the moment I consider myself a calm person, but I know that when I get
      stuck for too long It becomes annoying me.
    </p>

    <h2>
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This
      should include:
      <h3>
        An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and
        safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
        representatives
      </h3>
      <li>
        What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
      </li>
    </h2>
    <p>
      I am getting into the habit of planning my day in the beginning of each
      day, scheduling my time to reach the timebox and be productive. I will fit
      my group tasks into my personal tasks, planning them together in my day
      plan.
    </p>

    <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
    <p>
      When things are not going according to plan, my first attempt is to search
      on Stack Overflow and google, whatch videos on youtube. At the Bootcamp I
      will be able to chat to the colleagues and facilitators for help, if even
      after that I am not thinking that I can complete my tasks in time, I will
      make sure to let the Facilitators know before it gets too late.
    </p>

    <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
    <p>
      I expect them to give prompt help. I do not expect them to give me the
      solution, however to guide me to the right path.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed
      to other things.
      <h3>
        For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs.
        It's important to plan these in.
      </h3>
    </h2>
    <p>
      I do not have any commitments that will interfere with the bootcamp. I
      can't think about any scheduling conflicts.
