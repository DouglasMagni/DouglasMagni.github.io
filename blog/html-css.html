    <h1 class="center">Lets's talk about Positioned Elements</h1>
    <div>We are going to talk about 3 out of the 5 positioning elements.</div>
    <div>
      The positioned elements are crucial to specify how an element should be
      positioned in a document which causes the element to behave differently.
      They are: static, relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky. However, our
      focus will be on the 3 most common elements (relative, absolute, and
      fixed).
    </div>
    <h2>Relative position:</h2>
    <p>
      The element retains its flow in the document and occupies as much space as
      needed by default. The idea here is that the element is relative to its
      default position. Using these positioning elements moves the element
      around the default position without affecting others. Look at the image
      below:
    </p>
    <div class="flex.container center">
      <div>
        <img  src="relative-css.jpg" /> </div>
        <div><img src="relative-blocks.jpg" /></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      The blue block is still assumed to be filling up its default space, but
      positioning styles can move it around without pushing the others.
    </p>
    <h2>Absolute position:</h2>
    <p>
      Elements with the absolute position are positioned elements that work
      externally on the flow of the page. Their space on the screen is taken
      away from them and assigned to other elements. Look at the image below:
    </p>
    <div class="flex.container center">
      <div>
        <img src="absolute-css.jpg" /> </div>
        <div><img src="absolute-image.jpg" /></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      As shown above, the blue block's space earlier is now replaced by the
      green block. It does not affect the others. You can see it as the absolute
      element in its territory outside the container. it's important to mention
      that the absolute position considers the closest relative positioned
      parent, and if none, they are placed within the viewport (browser window).
    </p>
    <h2>Fixed position:</h2>
    <p>
      The fixed position is similar to the absolute position. The difference is
      that the fixed position does not respect any relative parents (or
      ancestors). It only respects the viewport. Look at the image below:
    </p>
    <div class="flex.container center">
      <div>
        <img src="fixed-css.jpg" /> </div>
        <div clas="flex.container center"><img src="fixed-image.jpg" /></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      The fixed element only respects the viewport regardless of the relative
      parent.
    </p>
    <h2>Wrap Up</h2>
    <p>
      In CSS, we have positioned and non-positioned elements. Non-positioned
      elements appear as the flow is declared in the markup. This applies to the
      static position style. Positioned elements may appear in the same flow in
      some cases (sticky and relative) and may not in some other cases
      (absolute, fixed), but they can be controlled with positioning styles
      (top, left, right, bottom).
