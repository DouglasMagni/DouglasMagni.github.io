    <h2>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>

    <p>I see the bootcamp as an opportunity to learn what is necessary to start a new career, as I want to become a senior software developer, be an expert in some software dev skill.
    </p>
I want to have the opportunity to use the knowledge gained in the bootcamp to get a job as a junior software developer and be able to deliver more than just junior software skills, but also contribute my personal values to the company in which I am offered the opportunity.
<p>
I believe that perseverance will be a strong point in my favor. I am aware that I am giving up a lot to do the bootcamp and that I have to use this determination to achieve my goals.
On the other hand, the fact that I am not a native English speaker can influence my learning, because the content we are learning is already difficult itself, in a fast and dynamic environment this can make it a little more challenging.
</p>
During foundations, I believe that I have gained the ability to accomplish what I have to learn at each moment instead of wanting to learn everything at once.
<p>
Something that I hope to evolve during the bootcamp is my self-confidence to learn and also the ability to work under pressure and deal with it.
When I leave something behind, I have difficulty stopping thinking about it and it doesn't add anything to the situation.
I also want to learn how to have the ability to continue studying after the bootcamp, mainly due to the fact that in the Tech industry, we must always be a student and updating ourselves. I hope to adopt this habit.
</p>
In terms of support, I believe that it should be provided at any time when identified that it's important. Sometimes people don't even notice that they need support, because they are too focused on their routine.
I hope that if it is identified by the bootcamp that some type of support is needed, it will be said.
<p>
I hope to give 100% of myself during this period to do the most of it, I commit to being patient and having a Team Work attitude towards my colleagues.

<h2>Foundations Learning Plan</h2>
    <p class="center">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p>
    <p>
      The ultimate goal is to have a solid career as a software developer so
      that I have location flexibility.
    </p>

    <h2>
      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
    </h2>
    <p>
      I have some difficulty to learn through reading, sometimes when it's a
      difficult content, I need to read again to completely absorb the idea. I
      would always prefer to whatch videos instead of reading tutorials.
    </p>

    <p class="center">
      What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
      developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </p>
    <p>
      I would love to see my ability to work well under pressure to improve. At
      the moment I consider myself a calm person, but I know that when I get
      stuck for too long It becomes annoying to me.
    </p>

    <h2>
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This
      should include:
      <h3>
        An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and
        safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
        representatives
      </h3>
      <li>
        What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
      </li>
    </h2>
    <p>
      I am getting into the habit of planning my day in the beginning of each
      day, scheduling my time to reach the timebox and be productive. I will fit
      my group tasks into my personal tasks, planning them together in my day
      plan.
    </p>

    <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
    <p>
      When things are not going according to plan, my first attempt is to search
      on Stack Overflow and google, whatch videos on youtube. At the Bootcamp I
      will be able to chat to the colleagues and facilitators for help, if even
      after that I am not thinking that I can complete my tasks in time, I will
      make sure to let the Facilitators know before it gets too late.
    </p>

    <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
    <p>
      I expect them to give prompt help. I do not expect them to give me the
      solution, however to guide me to the right path.
    </p>
    <p class="center">
      Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed
      to other things.
      <h3>
        For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs.
        It's important to plan these in.
      </h3>
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not have any commitments that will interfere with the bootcamp. I
      can't think about any scheduling conflicts.
