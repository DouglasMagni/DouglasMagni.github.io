    <h2>Putting problem solving skills to be tested and improved</h2>
    <p>
        This week I faced a more challenging week technically speaking, where I put my knowledge about JavaScript to be improved and tested, leaving the comfort zone, where I had experiences of the most diverse types, such as: satisfying, challenging, frustrating.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most importantly, I got the opportunity to improve my problem solving skills and how to and not to act in each of these situations.
    </p>

    <h2>When I elegantly solved a problem:</h2>
    <p>
        One of the JavaScript Kata that I was confident and felt it improving as I was coding and able to understand every step that as I was taking, was the Manipulating Objects activity.
       </p>
      
      <p>In this exercise, we had to assign values ​​to objects using the object literal notation, also add and edit keys, putting the objects together.</p> 
      <p>Bringing this to a non-technical form, I was manipulating two people that are a couple, bringing the code structure to the real-world, making an allusion to a couple, demonstrating a usual way to apply objects and use them in our lives.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>When I was blocked on a simple problem:</h2>
<p>There was an exercise asking to create a functon that would return the average of an array, so at first I thought about the problem and I was like: "okay, that should not be difficult, because I know the logic behind it".</p>
   <p> <strong>However,</strong> even thinking I was on the right path, I wasn't able to proceed with the tests accurately, so I researched other methods of doing the average from an array and turns out I was going by the longest way possible and getting stuck often because of that.
    That's when I realized that Keeping an Open Mind to trying new ideas and approaches is essential.</p>
   <div class="flex.container center">

<p>Sometimes, the best solution may come from thinking outside the box or considering alternative methods.</p>
<p> I definitely learned the lesson of always keeping an open mind to different alternatives.</p>

<h2>How confident am I with each of these problem-solving techniques?</h2>
<p>Reflecting about the problem solving techniques I used this week, I can say that I consider myself confidence level (0 - 100) as below:</p>
