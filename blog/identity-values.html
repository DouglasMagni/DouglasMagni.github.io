    <h2>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h2>
    <p class="center">A bit about my journey in New Zealand</p>
    <p>
      After moving to New Zealand, I started my journey here working in
      construction, as a pathway to became a New Zealander Resident, while
      working in that sector, I used to help some people with different kinds of
      problems.

    <p>
      There was period when I used to bring some food for one of my colleagues
      every Monday and Tuesday as he had spent all his money over the weekend.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a couple of months, he got into strange behavior, blaming me and my
      colleagues for things he did wrong and we argued and he left the company.
      Today I understand that he did my part by advising and helping a person in
      need, but it's not always that we change the next person.

    <p class="center">I am originally from Brazil</p>
    <p>
      I am As Brazilian, we tend to care about others, to give emotional
      support, we try to go deep into the other's people problems and provide
      them with real help, which makes me build and identity. I believe this can
      help to have a good relationship with my colleagues and create a good
      study environment.

    <p class="center">learning method</p>
    <p>
      I am a visual person, I would always prefer to whatch videos then read
      tutorials. It may affect my way of learning because sometimes I may not
      have time to watch videos.

      There was a time when I was working as a service desk technician, helping
      a client on he phone and everyone was talking loudly at office, so I told
      the client I would call back soon, and send an email with some tips to
      help with the issue.
