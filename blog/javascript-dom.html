    <h2>The DOM as a Family Tree:</h2>
    <p>
      Imagine a family tree where each person, relationship, and event is
      represented in a structured way. This family tree is like the Document
      Object Model (DOM) for a webpage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each person in the family corresponds to an HTML element, like a parent,
      child, or grandparent. Relationships, such as siblings or cousins, are
      like the parent-child relationships between HTML elements.
    </p>
    <div class="flex.container center">
      <img src="dom tree 2.png" />
    </div>
    <p>
      The DOM, like a family tree, provides a structured representation of
      elements on a webpage. JavaScript allows you to interact with this
      structure, adding, removing, or modifying elements, just as you might do
      in a family tree by adding new family members or updating relationships.
    </p>
    <h2>The relationship between Java Script, CSS and HTML</h2>
    <p>
      Let's explore more about the
      relationship between three very powerful technologies used in web
      development, which are Java Script, CSS and HTML. 
      <p></p>Using a technical
      vocabulary, I would say that the HTML provides the structure, CSS styles
      the elements, and JavaScript adds interactivity to create a rich and
      dynamic web experience. These technologies work together to build the
      websites and applications we interact with daily. </p>
      <p class="center">But that's too much technical, right?</p> 
      <p>Let me explain this in other words. Think about your
      garden, HTML represents the Garden Layout, specifying where the plants,
      flowers, and paths are located and what they are. The CSS is the Garden
      Decoration, adding aesthetic elements, like colors, borders, and styles,
      making the garden visually pleasing.</p> 
      <p>In terms of the JavaScript is the
      Automated Watering System, automating tasks, such as watering the plants
      based on predefined conditions or user interactions.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>Control flow and loops</h2>
<p>Control flow is like navigating through traffic lights. The decision to stop, go, or wait is determined by the state of the traffic light.</p>
   <p> If the light is green, proceed with the flow (execute certain code). If it's red, stop (skip or handle another set of instructions). If it's yellow, slow down or prepare for a change. </p>
   <div class="flex.container center">
   <img src="car signal2.jpg" /></div>
<p>Control flow is like navigating through traffic lights. The decision to stop, go, or wait is determined by the state of the traffic light.
    If the light is green, proceed with the flow (execute certain code). If it's red, stop (skip or handle another set of instructions). If it's yellow, slow down or prepare for a change.</p>
<p class="center">The same situation can be used to exemplain about Loops.</p>
<p> Loops in programming are like driving a car on a specific route, where you might encounter traffic lights, intersections, or different conditions repeatedly.
    Imagine you're driving a car and you approach a series of traffic lights along the route.</p>
    <div class="flex.container center">
        <img src="car signal.PNG" /></div>
        <p>The loop represents the journey through a sequence of traffic lights. The car (code) follows the route, encountering different conditions (traffic lights) and responding accordingly. The loop continues until the car reaches the destination (end of the loop).
            Basically, loops repeatedly execute a set of actions based on certain conditions, just as driving a car involves navigating through various conditions along a route. </p>

<h2>Arrays and Objects</h2>
<p class="center"> Arrays and bookshelves:</p>
<p>Arrays are like bookshelves in a library where books are arranged in a specific order, making it easy to locate a particular book.</p>
<div class="flex.container center">
    <img src="books.jpg" /></div>
    <p>In an array, elements (books) are stored in a sequence, and you can access each one by its position, just as you would pick a book from a specific shelf. It's important to mention that they start counting from 0. </p>

    <p class="center"> Objects and shopping for groceries:</p>
<p>Objects can be illustrated as you're shopping for groceries, and you have a shopping cart. Each item in your cart represents a grocery item with specific details, price, weight, brand...</p>
<p>The way to access it would be telling the name, then use a dot to call the price property of an item like an apple and bread objects.
    <p class="center"> For exemplo:</p> 
    <p>In this case, we would call: console.log(bread.price);</p>
    
<h2>Functions:</h2>
<p>A function is like a recipe. It's a set of instructions that you can follow to accomplish a specific task. Just as a recipe tells you how to make a cake, a function guides the computer on what actions to perform.</p>
<p>Functions provide a clear set of instructions for it to follow. They make coding more efficient, organized, and adaptable, just like following a good recipe makes cooking enjoyable and successful.</p>
