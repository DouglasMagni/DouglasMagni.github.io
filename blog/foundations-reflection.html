    <h2>The importance of Core skills</h2>

    <p>
      During this learning journey I realized how important the personal
      concepts are to get the most of the learning time. I realized that
      whithout a plan, a scope, and a mindset, there is no way to be productive
      and stay focused during each week. So having a plan is crucial to
      achieving short goals and later larger goals.
    </p>
    <h2>Values, empathy, and self-awareness</h2>
    <p>
      It's super important to use as much as you can from your values, empathy,
      and self-awareness over a learning period. These characteristics determine
      whether you will become a professional who has value beyond skills. In the
      modern industry, especially in the tech area, it's increasingly important
      to have the right characteristics for a team and not just individually.
    </p>

    <p>
      The core aspects of the course were something that I like to do, I like to
      read those articles and I could realize how important it's for me during
      my learning journey which is starting now.
    </p>
    <p class="center">What surprised me the most</p>
    <p>
      The fact that some topics I already had knowledge about but even so, when
      there is no interaction between you and the knowledge, it remains in the
      subconscious, and even though you have the knowledge, you end up not using
      it. So it is necessary to bring this to the surface to experience it.
    </p>
    <h2>The challenges faced</h2>
    <p>
      It was really challenging to keep my head straight when things weren't
      going well, even though I knew that's all part of it.
    </p>
    <p class="center">Having a strong mindset</p>
    <p>
      It appears that because I knew that the tendency was to always get more
      difficult, when you get stuck in something, the first thought is: "No way,
      I am already stuck here and it's supposed to be easy". But the truth
      behind this is that this learning journey is like a ladder, we have to
      climb one step at a time, there is no way to skip steps. It was difficult
      to accept at first.
    </p>
    <h2>Dev Academy and Core focusing</h2>
    <p>
      I believe that the dev academy has the knowledge about the industry and
      knows that in these days it is fundamental for a professional to have
      their head on straight and understand the aspects related to the person
      and learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am convinced that it was a productive time studying the core, because I
      understant the importance of it for the long term, and I as I said,
      something it's something that you know but you never stop to think and act
      accordingly, until you read/talk and reflect on it.
